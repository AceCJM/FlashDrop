FlashDrop is a secure, one-time file-sharing tool. Upload a file, get a unique link, and share it with one person. Once the recipient downloads it, the file and link are instantly deleted—forever. No accounts, no traces, no reuse. Perfect for sensitive documents, quick transfers, or when you want zero digital footprint.
